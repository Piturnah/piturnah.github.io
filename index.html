                <p>
                    Hello there! I am an A-Level student in the UK with a passionate interest in computers.
                    I got started programming using <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/">Scratch</a> when I was seven years old, and now I spend my time doing
                    a number of things from building games and simulations to some ethical hacking.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am working on this site in my spare time to experiment with web development and showcase some of my work.
                    For example, my <a href="/start-with-rain/">LD45 entry</a> or my ongoing <a href="/tetris-epq/">extended project
                    qualification</a> on machine learning. The source code for most of my projects can be found at
                    my <a href="https://github.com/Piturnah">GitHub page,</a> including the source for this website!
                </p>
                <h2>What am I doing?</h2>
                <p>
                    One of my biggest interests in programming is machine learning. I cannot pinpoint the origin of this, but
                    I remember trying (and failing horribly) to create AIs on Python as an eleven year old. In 2019, I combined this with my
                    interest in evolution to create my <a href="https://github.com/Piturnah/evosim">simulation of evolution by natural selection.</a>
                    This project involved simulating simple creatures in a simple environment containing only others of themselves and some food.
                    The creatures had the ability to mate with another of the opposite sex to produce offspring with mutated "genes", and this project
                    produced some interesting results which you can see here:
                </p>
                <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/598058319617458186/627976057412255756/unknown.png" alt="">
                <p>
                    The creatures also had an energy cost which was subtracted from their total energy over time (or from reproduction)
                    and could only be replenished with food. As seen from the graphs, these factors provided enough incentive for the population's
                    traits to evolve over time. While this isn't strictly machine learning, it ties into neuroevolution which is what I am using for 
                    <a href="https://github.com/Piturnah/tetris-ann-epq">my current project</a> which I am very excited about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another of my computing loves has been procedural generation. This is because when Minecraft came out, as a child I 
                    was awed by the endless possibilities of its world generation and by the fact it can create enormous terrains randomly yet without
                    being totally chaotic. After years of occasional attempts to recreate this effect, I recently managed to achieve a simple version
                    of this using Perlin Noise in <a href="/start-with-rain/">my entry</a> for October 2019's <a href="https://ldjam.com/">Ludum Dare</a> game jam
                    in the procedural generation of 2D deserts.
