## What does "Piturnah" mean?

Piturnah is the name I've been using online since around 2014, after I came up with it as a name for my character in one of the only [D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) sessions I've ever participated in. *pitur* is a bastardisation of my first name (Peter) *na* is the first two letters of my middle name, and *h* is the initial of my last name.

## What's the font?

[Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/). It's beautiful enough that I will totally disrespect your bandwidth for it.

## What's the favicon?

The water droplet icon I made for the game I submitted for my first ever game jam, which was the 45th [Ludum Dare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludum_Dare). You can find the jam submission [here](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/45/start-with-rain), or play it embedded [on this site](/start-with-rain/).
