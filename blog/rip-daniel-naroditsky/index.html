        <h1>Rest In Peace, Daniel "Danya" Naroditsky</h1>
        <p>-# 2025-10-23 #-</p>
      
      <p>This post might come a little unexpected, seeing as until now I’ve only been using this blog to discuss technical topics, particularly those relating to functional programming. However, the recent news of Danya’s passing has affected me quite deeply and I wanted to publically express some of my thoughts and pay a small tribute.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Naroditsky">Daniel Naroditsky</a> was a chess grandmaster from the United States. He was well-known not just for being one of the best chess players alive (especially in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_chess">blitz</a>), but also for his brilliant commentary and especially instruction. Naroditsky operated a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DanielNaroditskyGM">YouTube channel</a> where he posted chess educational content, primarily through his long-form <em>speed run</em> episodes.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> More extensive details of Danya’s achievements and contributions to the chess world can be readily found elsewhere on the Internet, and so I would like to use the majority of this post to talk about how he impacted me personally.</p>
<h2 id="danyas-impact-on-me">Danya’s impact on me</h2>
<p>This blog has been radio silent for more than seven months now. I am sorry to say that this hiatus reflects a general hiatus I have been taking on all areas of life as I have been going through some difficult times, times which I am extremely grateful to say I am recovering from. I had not really played chess since around 2018, but during the worst period of this I ended up rediscovering the famous PogChamps<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a> game of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e91M0XLX7Jw">xQc vs MoistCr1tikal</a>. Charlie’s historic celebration opens with the phrase</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Daniel Naroditsky is a <em>fucking prophet</em>!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as his opponent plays perfectly into a line that his coach had suggested could happen in the game. At this point, not being particularly into chess, I did not know who Danya was — but it was actually a name I knew I had heard before. Sebastian Lague, the very popular YouTuber/programmer who readers of this blog will surely be at least vaguely familiar with, off-handedly mentioned in his <a href="https://youtu.be/U4ogK0MIzqk?si=UZCB5ztP77byORj2&amp;t=1517">video</a> on chess engines that the move <code>f3</code> against the Nimzo-Indian Defense was recommended in a video by the very same Daniel Naroditsky.</p>
<p>I checked out his channel and immediately I was hooked. The level of enthusiasm and knowledge for the game was deeply infectious. He reminded me of what it looked and felt like to <em>really</em> love something, and his clarity of explanation made me feel like I did too. At a time where most days I was struggling to even get up, Danya’s love of chess spread to me and it quickly became the thing driving my life and reason for being. It seems a bit silly now, but at the time I truly could not perceive any reason to do anything at all. Getting absorbed in chess — something completely detached from my normal life — allowed me to ground myself after becoming completely lost. All the while watching countless hours of Naroditsky’s speed run videos, I soon started getting books on openings and learning from them religiously. In all I would spend up to nine hours per day studying chess with a newly rediscovered passion for life.</p>
<p>From there, I started going outside again. I joined the local club in my city and started regularly playing there. I am grateful not just for those new friends and experiences, but mainly for the way that this acted as a catalyst for me getting my sense of self back together in general. I no longer spend my entire waking day focused on this 2,000 year-old game, but I am in a much-improved psychological state than from before I started.</p>
<h2 id="why-publish-this">Why publish this?</h2>
<p>I found out about Danya’s tragic passing on October 20th when somebody sent a message about it in my club’s group chat. Out of respect for him and his family I will not be adding to speculation about what happened, but it was no secret that Danya was struggling more and more with his mental health in the last year of his life.</p>
<p>I never met Danya, but the many, <em>many</em> hours I spent with him during my worst weeks and months, and the way he specifically helped me get out of that, made this announcement a punch to the gut. At times it still doesn’t seem like reality. This is a great loss to chess, and to the world as a whole. Everybody you speak to in chess is sharing in this grief on some level, and I cannot begin to imagine the pain that his family and friends are going through during this time.</p>
<p>Given that I didn’t know him, I have gone back and forth on whether or not to actually publish this article. I am concerned that it may be in some way self-indulgent or otherwise inappropriate. But, Danya was extremely important to me, and I wanted to dedicate some space on my corner of the Internet to commemorate him, and to say thank you.</p>
<p>Aside from playing a monumental role in my personal recovery, Danya also taught me how to think about chess — and especially shaped my positional play. I play the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King%27s_Indian_Defence">King’s Indian</a> by his recommendation. Sitting over the board, I catch myself from time to time thinking in his voice.</p>
<p>The world we find ourselves involuntarily a part of can unfortunately be extremely difficult to navigate at times. Remember to look after the people you love.</p>

<p>Rest in peace Daniel Naroditsky, a.k.a. Danya, a.k.a. RebeccaHarris, a.k.a. <em>the Prophet</em>. We thank you for the time you shared with us at Frankfurt Airport.</p>
